# OneWare Studio - GOWIN Toolchain Extension

This extension integrates the **GOWIN FPGA toolchain** into **OneWare Studio**.

## Features
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform Support**: Tested on **Windows**, should work on **macOS** and **Linux** as well.
- 🔄 **Mixed Language Support**: Supports both **VHDL** and **Verilog** (SystemVerilog is untested).
- 🎯 **Timing Constraints**: Allows adding **timing constraints** via `.sdc` files.
- 🚀 **Simplified Workflow**: Enhances **OneWare Studio** with streamlined FPGA development.

## Installation & Usage
1. Add this extension to enable **GOWIN FPGA** support.
2. Set the Path in **Settings -> Tools -> Gowin**
2. Configure your project with `.vhd`, `.vhdl`, `.v`, `.sv`, `.sdc` files.
3. Use the **GOWIN toolchain** for synthesis and programming.

## Notes
- **SystemVerilog support is untested** but may work.
- Contributions and feedback are welcome!
